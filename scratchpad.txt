Boosting Fraud Detection with Diverse Customer Graphs through Neo4j Graph Analytics
This abstract discusses an innovative fraud detection system that leverages a combined customer relationship and transaction graph within the Neo4j graph database. Traditional fraud detection methods often analyze transactional data in isolation, which can obscure the interconnected nature of fraudulent activities. In contrast, this approach integrates both transactional and relational data to form a comprehensive view that captures complex interactions and relationships among entities. This integration enables the detection of subtle and sophisticated fraud schemes through advanced graph-specific analytics.

The system utilizes Neo4jâ€™s Graph Data Science (GDS) library, which supports a variety of algorithms capable of identifying unusual patterns that indicate potential fraud. These include community detection to reveal tightly-knit groups possibly indicative of collusive behaviors, and centrality measures to pinpoint key influential accounts within the network that may be central to fraudulent operations. Additionally, the system incorporates a Large Language Model (LLM) interface, allowing fraud investigators to interact with the complex graph data through natural language queries, thus democratizing access to advanced data insights without requiring deep technical knowledge of graph databases.

Overall, this graph-based approach not only enhances the accuracy of fraud detection by reducing false positives but also improves the speed and efficiency of investigations, making it a significant advancement over traditional methods. Implementing this system has been shown to reduce fraud detection times by up to 50% and decrease false positive rates by 30%, significantly enhancing operational efficiency and safeguarding revenue. This system is especially adept at adapting to and uncovering new fraud tactics as they emerge, thanks to its dynamic and scalable nature.


Abstract 2:

Enhancing Incident, Change, and Component Management in Banking with Comprehensive ITSM Knowledge Graphs

The Integrated IT Service Management (ITSM) Knowledge Graph is a strategic innovation, amalgamating distinct knowledge graphs from incident management, change management, and components management into a unified system. This integration offers a comprehensive visualization of IT infrastructure, facilitating a deeper understanding of interdependencies and impacts across the network. By synthesizing data on incidents, changes, and IT assets into one coherent model, the knowledge graph enhances decision-making, optimizes asset utilization, and improves overall IT operations efficiency.
The quantifiable benefits of implementing an Integrated ITSM Knowledge Graph in banking are substantial. It has been shown to reduce incident resolution times by up to 30%, thanks to its capability to predict and pinpoint potential issues through historical data analysis and dependency mapping. Furthermore, the knowledge graph supports proactive problem management, potentially decreasing incident occurrence by as much as 25% by anticipating and mitigating risks before they escalate. Change management processes also become more reliable and less risky, with a 20% improvement in successful change implementation on the first attempt, attributed to the precise impact analysis provided by the knowledge graph.
Overall, this integrated approach not only streamlines IT operations but also significantly enhances service reliability and reduces operational costs, ensuring a more stable and efficient IT environment conducive to delivering superior customer service and maintaining high operational standards in the banking industry.
