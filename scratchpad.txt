### Slide 1: Problem Statement
**Enhancing Incident, Change, and Component Management in Banking with Comprehensive ITSM Knowledge Graphs**

- Siloed data in incident, change, and component management.
- Lack of comprehensive visualization of IT infrastructure.
- Inefficient decision-making due to fragmented data.
- Difficulty in understanding interdependencies and impacts.
- High incident resolution times.
- Ineffective change management processes.
- Limited accessibility to advanced data insights.

### Slide 2: Proposed Solution
**Integrated ITSM Knowledge Graph**

- Unification of incident, change, and component management data.
- Comprehensive visualization of IT infrastructure.
- Enhanced decision-making with a coherent data model.
- Improved understanding of interdependencies and impacts.
- Reduced incident resolution times through predictive analysis.
- More reliable and less risky change management.
- Natural language interface for intuitive data interaction.

### Slide 4: Sample ITSM Knowledge Graph Representation

```mermaid
graph TD
    subgraph "ITSM Knowledge Graph"
        subgraph "Incident Management"
            IM1(Incident: Login Failure)
            IM2(Incident: Transaction Timeout)
            IM3(Incident: Data Sync Error)
        end

        subgraph "Change Management"
            CM1(Change: Patch Update)
            CM2(Change: Server Upgrade)
            CM3(Change: Configuration Change)
        end

        subgraph "Components Management"
            C1(Component: Authentication Server)
            C2(Component: Database Server)
            C3(Component: Application Server)
        end

        IM1 -->|Caused by| C1
        IM2 -->|Caused by| C3
        IM3 -->|Caused by| C2

        CM1 -->|Affects| C1
        CM2 -->|Affects| C2
        CM3 -->|Affects| C3

        C3 -->|Connects to| C2
        C3 -->|Connects to| C1
    end

    IM1 -->|Resolved by| CM1
    IM2 -->|Resolved by| CM3
