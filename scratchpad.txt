Key Differences Highlighted:
Session Management: Focuses on preserving and restoring the user's exact session state, providing a seamless continuation of activities post-login.
Deep Linking: Focuses on navigating users to specific sections or features within the app via URLs or links, but without preserving the user's state or previous actions.
In summary, while both approaches enhance user navigation and experience, the session management solution offers a more granular and stateful continuity, whereas deep linking provides efficient direct access but without state preservation.
