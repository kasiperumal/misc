Slide 1: Problem Statement
* Stagnant Feature Set
    * Online banking platforms often do not evolve quickly to match changing user needs or competitor offerings.
* Overcrowded User Interface
    * Many rarely-used or obsolete features remain visible, leading to customer confusion.
* Inefficient Feedback Utilization
    * Manual processes make it hard to continuously ingest feedback from multiple sources (social media, app reviews, etc.) in real time.

Slide 2: Solution
* AI-Driven Gap Analysis
    * Competitor Analysis Agent gathers and compares rival banking features.
    * Feedback Analysis Agent collects user feedback from diverse channels.
    * App Feature Developer Agent generates new feature proposals with help from a Large Language Model (LLM).
* Usage-Based Deprecation
    * App Feature Deprecator Agent monitors clickstream data to flag underused features.
    * Customers get the option to remove or hide these features—personalizing their interface.

Slide 3: Online Banking Business Use Cases (with Examples)
1. Personalized Interface Streamlining
    * Example: A customer who never uses “bill splitting” for 12 months is prompted to remove it.
2. Rapid Competitive Response
    * Example: A rival launches “crypto wallet integration.” The AI system detects this gap and proposes a similar or improved feature.
3. Continuous User-Centric Upgrades
    * Example: App store reviews highlight clunky loan application processes. The system synthesizes feedback and generates a new, streamlined feature requirement.

Slide 4: Novelty
* Dynamic Feature Lifecycle
    * Automates both feature introduction and removal, adapting the platform in near real-time.
* Deep Language Model Insights
    * Uses LLMs to interpret unstructured user feedback and competitor data, going beyond simple analytics.
* Multi-Agent Architecture
    * Specialized agents (competitor analysis, feedback analysis, feature development, deprecation) ensure an end-to-end, AI-driven workflow with minimal manual intervention.

Slide 5: Business Benefits
* Increased Customer Satisfaction
    * Streamlined interfaces and timely feature additions improve user experience and loyalty.
* Reduced Maintenance Costs
    * Deprecating underused features frees up infrastructure and support resources.
* Faster Time-to-Market
    * AI automates significant parts of competitive research and feature prioritization, speeding up development cycles.
* Data-Driven Strategy
    * LLM-driven insights from competitor platforms and feedback channels guide strategic product decisions accurately and efficiently.

Slide 1: Problem Statement
* Static, Non-Personalized Product Recommendations
    * Traditional banking portals offer blanket promotions that often fail to match individual customer interests.
* Slow Detection of Regulatory Issues
    * Manual or periodic compliance checks lag behind real-time transactions and issues arising from user behavior or external feedback.
* Fragmented Feedback Sources
    * Comments and complaints from social media, app reviews, and system logs are rarely integrated promptly for compliance action.

Slide 2: Solution
* Multi-Agent Architecture (All LLM-Driven)
    * Product Interest Agent analyzes clickstream/video data to infer customer product interest.
    * Product Recommendation Agent refines offers using LLM insights for personalization.
    * Compliance Monitoring Agent collects feedback from external channels and internal logs, leveraging a multi-modal LLM (text, video) to detect policy or regulatory breaches.
* Real-Time Adaptation
    * Banking platform updates offers on the homepage and escalates compliance issues automatically, providing up-to-date status notifications.

Slide 3: Online Banking Business Use Cases (with Examples)
1. Personalized Mortgage/Loan Offers
    * Example: Customer frequently visits mortgage calculators; the system detects high interest in home loans and displays relevant promotions plus next steps to apply.
2. Immediate Fraud/Compliance Alerts
    * Example: A surge of social media complaints about ATM withdrawal errors triggers compliance checks. The system automatically flags a potential regulatory violation and opens a ticket.
3. Upselling & Cross-Selling
    * Example: A high-value customer with multiple accounts consistently visits investment pages. The platform proactively suggests wealth management packages or premium credit cards.

Slide 4: Novelty
1. Integrated Product & Compliance Agents
    * Harmonizes sales strategies (recommendations) with legal and policy oversight (compliance).
2. Real-Time, Multi-Modal LLM Analysis
    * Combines text logs, video session captures, and user clickstream data to offer immediate, context-aware decisions.
3. Customer-Centric Homepage Updates
    * Dynamically modifies the user interface with personalized offers and ticket status notifications regarding any compliance concerns.

Slide 5: Business Benefits
* Increased Conversion & Engagement
    * Targeted product offers boost customer uptake and loyalty.
* Rapid Compliance & Risk Mitigation
    * Automated detection and ticketing for potential violations reduce legal exposure and reputational harm.
* Efficiency & Scalability
    * Agents handle routine analysis and triage, minimizing manual overhead for customer service and compliance teams.
* Enhanced Customer Trust
    * Users see transparent updates on pending issues and personalized offers, fostering a sense of security and relevance.
