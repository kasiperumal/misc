Generate a detailed technical specification document suitable for development using GitHub Copilot that describes enhancing an existing JIRA MCP and AI agent. The enhancement involves creating a Product Owner Assistant AI Agent. It must accept various delivery milestones as inputs, track progress daily against JIRA epics (including subtasks or stories) managed by multiple Scrum teams in parallel sprints, and evaluate if deliveries align with set milestones. The solution should summarize daily progress when milestones are on track, and when off-track, clearly identify blockers, delays, or issues, prioritizing action items for the Product Owner.
