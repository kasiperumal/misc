Title: AI-Powered Personalized Banking Pages
Subtitle: Enhancing Customer Experience with an Autonomic AI Agent

Title: The Challenge in Online Banking

Customers often struggle to find relevant information on banking websites.
This leads to frustration, unnecessary contact center calls, or even switching to competitors.
A lack of personalization impacts customer engagement and satisfaction.

Title: AI Solution Workflow â€“ From Feedback to Personalized Pages
graph TD;
    A[Customer Visits Banking Site] -->|Cannot find info| B[Presses Dislike Button on the page & Gives Feedback];
    B --> C[AI Agent w/ LLM Processes Feedback];
    C --> D[Reasoning Step: Understand Customer Need];
    D -->|If Relevant Info Exists| E[Retrieve Data from Knowledge Base];
    D -->|If New Info Needed| F[Query Internal/External Banking APIs];
    E --> G[Generate Personalized Page with Relevant Info];
    F --> G;
    G --> H[Compliance Agent Validates Page];
    H -->|Approved| I[Display Personalized Page to Customer];
    I -->|If Customer Likes Page| K[Store as Preferred Page for Customer];

Title: AI-Powered Personalization Framework
