  - Distinct color (green) enhances quick visual verification.
- **Embedded Microtext:**
  - Tiny, readable text along tick perimeter for anti-tampering.
  - Provides immediate visual evidence of authenticity.

### **Layer 2: Cryptographic Validation**
- **SHA-256 Hashing:** 
  - Converts tick metadata (coordinates, color, microtext) into a unique cryptographic hash.
- **Asymmetric Encryption (Public-Private keys):**
  - Secure encryption/decryption ensuring data integrity and preventing unauthorized replication.

---

## **Slide 5: Technical Workflow**
- **Data Segmentation:**
  - Main payload → Standard QR modules.
  - Security tick parameters → secondary data layer.
- **Structural Encoding:**
  - Geometric integration of tick and embedded microtext.
  - Hash encryption of tick data.
- **Printing & Production:**
  - Base (black/white) layer plus colored tick overlay.

---

## **Slide 5: Authentication Mechanisms**

- **Human Verification:** 
  - Immediate authenticity check via colored tick and microtext.
- **Digital Verification (using standard QR scanner and DSVT apps):**
  - Geometry extraction through edge detection.
  - Decryption and cryptographic validation of embedded metadata.

- **Regulatory Compliance:**
  - Meets standards for document and product authenticity verification.

---

## **Slide 8: Patent Strategy & Claims**
- Clear novelty (integration of visible and cryptographic validation).
- High non-obviousness due to unique combination of cryptographic and geometric steganography.
- Significant commercial and security utility across sectors.

---

## **Slide 9: Conclusion & Next Steps**
- Strong recommendation for immediate patent filing.
- Proposed roadmap:
  - Immediate patent application drafting.
  - Proof-of-concept development.
  - Initial deployments targeting high-risk industries.

---

## Technical Concept Clarifications (brief):

- **SHA-256 Hashing:**
  - A secure cryptographic hashing algorithm converting data into a fixed-size hash, providing data integrity and verification capabilities.

- **Asymmetric Encryption:**
  - A cryptographic method involving two related keys:
    - **Private Key:** Secret key used to encrypt data.
    - **Public Key:** Shared key to decrypt and verify the data authenticity.

- **Microtext:**
  - Tiny text embedded into QR patterns, readable under magnification, difficult to replicate, offering robust anti-counterfeiting protection.
