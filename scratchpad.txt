Visual Financial Statements with Emoji Categorization


Generate emoji (using GenAI) for each payment transaction based on the very top category of item purchased in a given merchant invoice or emoji of item purchased (Ex. if only one item in merchant invoice) or emoji for non-merchant transaction(Ex. if its like account to account transfer or zelle etc..) based on transaction purpose entered. When account summary statement is generated, there is emoji against each transaction which helps me to recall the transaction which makes account summary review easy for customer.

### 1. Problem Statement (150 words)

Customers often find it challenging to recall details of their past transactions when reviewing account statements. Traditional bank statements provide only textual information, such as merchant names, transaction dates, and amounts, which can be vague and uninformative. This lack of clarity can lead to confusion, increased time spent cross-referencing receipts, and difficulty managing finances. Moreover, this problem is exacerbated for individuals with numerous small transactions, such as frequent purchases at various stores or online platforms. Without an intuitive and quick way to identify the nature of each transaction, customers struggle to maintain a clear overview of their spending habits, potentially impacting their financial planning and budgeting efforts.

### 2. Solution (200 words)

Integrating emojis into transaction summaries can significantly enhance the clarity and user-friendliness of account statements. By automatically generating an emoji based on the top category of items purchased in a given merchant invoice or the specific item in case of single-item purchases, customers can quickly and visually identify the nature of each transaction. For non-merchant transactions, such as account-to-account transfers or services like Zelle, an emoji representing the transaction's purpose can be used. This visual representation can make the review process much more intuitive and efficient.

The solution involves deploying an AI-driven system that analyzes transaction data and assigns appropriate emojis. This system can be integrated with existing banking apps and online platforms. When a customer reviews their account summary, each transaction will be accompanied by an emoji, providing an instant visual cue about the transaction. This method not only saves time but also improves the overall user experience by making financial management simpler and more engaging.

### 3. Couple of Use Cases (in brief)

1. **Retail Purchases**: A customer buys groceries from a supermarket. The transaction is tagged with a grocery bag emoji.
2. **Utility Payments**: A customer pays their electricity bill. The transaction is tagged with a light bulb emoji.

### 4. Elaborate Same Use Cases (150 words each)

**Retail Purchases**: 
When a customer purchases items from a supermarket, the transaction data is analyzed to identify the top category of items bought. Suppose the primary items are groceries, an AI-driven system assigns a grocery bag emoji to this transaction. This emoji appears next to the transaction in the account summary. When the customer later reviews their statement, the grocery bag emoji provides an immediate visual indication that the transaction was related to grocery shopping. This helps the customer quickly recall the nature of the purchase without needing to delve into detailed receipts or merchant descriptions, thus enhancing their ability to track and manage their spending.

**Utility Payments**: 
For a customer paying their electricity bill, the system recognizes the merchant as a utility provider and assigns a light bulb emoji to the transaction. This emoji appears next to the payment entry in the customer's account summary. When the customer checks their statement, the light bulb emoji instantly signifies an electricity bill payment. This visual cue simplifies the review process, making it easier for the customer to differentiate between various types of transactions and ensuring that utility payments are easily identifiable, which can aid in budget planning and financial tracking.
