Problem Statement Title
Customer Account Funnel Analysis Agent

Problem Statement Description
The current process for analyzing the customer account opening journey is manual, time-consuming, and resource-intensive. This analysis, which is performed daily, involves tracking customer progress through various funnel milestones to identify drop-offs (churn) and understand the root causes behind them. The key data sources include:

C2T Database: Contains milestone-level customer journey data.

Splunk Logs: Capture system and error events relevant to the user journey.

Glassbox: Provides behavioral data for user interaction analysis.

Due to the complexity and frequency of the analysis, thereâ€™s a need to automate this process using an AI-powered agent that can intelligently correlate data across these systems, identify patterns of churn, diagnose root causes, and recommend actionable steps to improve conversion.

Expected Outcome
An AI-based automated solution that analyzes the customer account funnel daily.

Identification of churn points in the customer account opening journey.

Root cause analysis combining system logs and behavioral data.

Actionable recommendations to improve user journey and reduce churn.

A dashboard or report output that summarizes findings and trends for business and technical teams
