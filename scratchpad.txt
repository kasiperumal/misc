Detecting fraud in transaction logs using reinforcement learning involves preparing and labeling data, extracting relevant features, and defining an environment where each transaction is a state. An agent analyzes transactions, receiving rewards for correct fraud identifications and penalties for errors. Using reinforcement learning algorithms, the agent is trained on historical data to optimize its detection strategy. After validation, the model is deployed for real-time monitoring and continuously updated with new data. A feedback loop involving human analysts helps refine the model, ensuring accurate and adaptive fraud detection.
