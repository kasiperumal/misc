Fraud Prevention Theme:
My idea is about behavioural replay prevention in a non-intrusive way.
Problem: Let's say old person end up installing malicious mobile app in his mobile which captures touchscreen behaviour of the person and replayed the same to monetise at later point of time.
Solution: To create deep learning model which can be used for liveness detection using ambience context correlation feature. Ambience context includes lighting, orientation, movement. Even other features such as varying pressure sensitivity, non-linear swipe analytics can be combined with ambience context correlation to create deep learning model which can detect this behavioural replay in real-time and interdict for secondary authentication when necessary.

Personalization Theme:
My idea is about Digital Onboarding Personalisation using behavioural analytics.
All digital customers are not of same persona then why onboarding forms and process would be same for everyone. Some are tech-savvy who are comfortable with digital interface, Some are frequent online bankers who have good hang of digital online banking services, Some are traditional who prefer in-person assistance or video guidance, some are occasional users who needs more support than others.
Solution is to capture their behaviour and segment them into one of the above and personalise onboarding accordingly to them. 
For example,
- **Tech-Savvy Users**:
  - Streamlined onboarding process with minimal steps.
  - Quick navigation options and advanced features access.
- **Frequent Online Bankers**:
  - Fast-tracked onboarding process.
  - Focus on advanced banking features and quick setup.
- **Traditional Users**:
  - Onboarding with detailed step-by-step instructions.
  - Video tutorials and live support options.
- **Occasional Users**:
  - Additional support with more touchpoints.
  - Simplified instructions to facilitate completion.
This will reduce the drop-off rate and also make user personas to love our digital experience offered.
