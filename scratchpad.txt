Generative AI-Driven Compliance-Integrated Product Ideation System for Financial Services

Certainly! Here's a structured presentation outline addressing the issue of Wells Fargo's improper mortgage rate-lock extension fees and how an AI-driven system can enhance transparency and compliance in product design.

Slide 1: Problem Statement
Background:
* Between 2013 and 2017, Wells Fargo charged borrowers rate-lock extension fees even when delays were due to the bank's own processing issues.
* These fees ranged from 0.125% to 0.25% of the loan amount. For example, on a $400,000 mortgage, a 0.25% fee equates to $1,000.
* Approximately $98 million in such fees were charged to 110,000 borrowers. citeturn0search5
* The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) found that Wells Fargo violated the Consumer Financial Protection Act in how it charged these fees. citeturn0search0
Implications:
* Erosion of customer trust.
* Regulatory penalties and reputational damage.
* Need for systems that ensure compliance and transparency.

Slide 3: Explanation of Rate Lock Extension Fees
What is a Rate Lock?
* A rate lock guarantees a borrower a specific interest rate for a set period, typically 30 to 60 days.
* If the loan doesn't close within this period, an extension may be required.
Extension Fees:
* Fees charged to extend the rate lock period.
* Typically range from 0.125% to 0.25% of the loan amount.
* For a $500,000 loan, this could be $625 to $1,250.
Issues Identified:
* Wells Fargo charged these fees even when delays were due to their own processing inefficiencies.
* Borrowers were often unaware or misinformed about the reasons for the fees.

Slide 4: Business Use Cases
1. Transparent Mortgage Products:
* AI-generated mortgage offerings with clear terms regarding rate locks and associated fees.
2. Real-Time Compliance Monitoring:

Integrating SHRP Policies into Development Workflow
Objective:
Convert SHRP remediation issues into enforceable policies and integrate them into the CI pipeline to detect and resolve compliance issues during development.
Process Overview:
1. Policy Generation:
    * Analyze SHRP data to identify recurring compliance issues.
    * Formulate these issues into specific, testable policies. 
2. Static Code Analyzer Integration:
    * Develop or configure a static code analysis tool to enforce SHRP-derived policies.
    * Ensure the analyzer can scan code for patterns that may lead to compliance violations. 
3. CI Pipeline Integration:
    * Embed the static code analyzer into the CI pipeline.
    * Set up the pipeline to automatically scan code upon commits or pull requests.
    * Configure the pipeline to block merges if SHRP policy violations are detected. CodeRabbit+5Medium+5Reddit+5blog.codacy.com
4. Developer Feedback Loop:
    * Provide immediate feedback to developers on policy violations.
    * Offer guidance or automated fixes where possible to resolve issues promptly.
