### Slide 1: What is Integrated ITSM Knowledge Graph

**Integrated ITSM Knowledge Graph:**
- Combines incident management, change management, and component management into a unified system
- Provides a comprehensive visualization of IT infrastructure
- Enhances understanding of interdependencies and impacts across the network
- Synthesizes data from incidents, changes, and IT assets into one coherent model
- Improves decision-making and optimizes asset utilization

---

### Slide 2: Problem Statement

**Problem Statement:**
- Fragmented IT management systems lead to inefficiencies
- Difficulty in understanding interdependencies among incidents, changes, and components
- Prolonged incident resolution times due to lack of comprehensive data
- High risk in change management due to insufficient impact analysis
- Need for proactive problem management to minimize incident occurrence

### Slide 4: Sample ITSM Knowledge Graph Representation

**Sample ITSM Knowledge Graph:**

```mermaid
graph TD
    subgraph "ITSM Knowledge Graph"
        subgraph "Incident Management"
            IM1(Incident: Login Failure)
            IM2(Incident: Transaction Timeout)
            IM3(Incident: Data Sync Error)
        end

        subgraph "Change Management"
            CM1(Change: Patch Update)
            CM2(Change: Server Upgrade)
            CM3(Change: Configuration Change)
        end

        subgraph "Components Management"
            C1(Component: Authentication Server)
            C2(Component: Database Server)
            C3(Component: Application Server)
        end

        IM1 -->|Caused by| C1
        IM2 -->|Caused by| C3
        IM3 -->|Caused by| C2

        CM1 -->|Affects| C1
        CM2 -->|Affects| C2
        CM3 -->|Affects| C3

        C3 -->|Connects to| C2
        C3 -->|Connects to| C1
    end

    IM1 -->|Resolved by| CM3
    IM2 -->|Resolved by| CM1
    IM3 -->|Resolved by| CM2
```
