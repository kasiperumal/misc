A leading financial services company is upgrading its digital security measures to better protect client data and ensure secure transactions. By implementing a Device Trust Engine, the firm can now manage user authentication adaptively, based on real-time risk assessments of both static and dynamic device parameters such as device ID, location changes, and network behavior.

Upon user login, the system analyzes these parameters, dynamically categorizing devices into risk clusters:

Low-risk devices are processed through routine authentication, maintaining user convenience and operational efficiency.
Moderate-risk devices trigger additional verification steps, such as one-time passwords or security questions, to validate access attempts that deviate from the norm yet may still be legitimate.
High-risk devices, identified either initially or after multiple failures in step-up authentication, require multi-factor authentication and may necessitate direct interaction with a customer contact center for reset approval, significantly enhancing security measures against potential breaches.
This robust and adaptive approach not only improves security against evolving cyber threats but also builds deeper trust with customers by demonstrating a proactive stance in safeguarding personal and financial informationâ€”an essential asset for sustaining a competitive edge in the financial sector. Subsequent in-session transactions continue to assess risk using dynamic parameters only, ensuring continuous security vigilance without repeated checks on static data. This method reduces friction in user interactions while maintaining high security standards throughout the customer journey.
