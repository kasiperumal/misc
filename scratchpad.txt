### Correct Approach
We can use the `| makeresults` and `| gentimes` commands to explicitly create a continuous time range, ensuring `_time` and `total` fields are displayed even if no events exist in the queried hour.

```spl
| makeresults 
| eval earliest=strptime("2025-01-24T10:00:00", "%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S"), latest=earliest + 3600
| gentimes start=earliest end=latest increment=1h
| eval total=0
| append [
    search index="x" earliest=earliest latest=latest
    | rex field=msg.message "stone=\"(?<stone>[^\"]+)"
    | eval total=if(stone="abc", 1, 0)
    | timechart span=1h sum(total) as total
]
| stats sum(total) as total by _time
| fillnull value=0 total
