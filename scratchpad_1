———————————

Slide 1: Problem Statement
* Stagnant Feature Set
    * Traditional online banking platforms struggle to evolve quickly, leading to feature gaps vs. competitor offerings.
* Overcrowded Interface
    * Rarely used or obsolete features remain visible, making navigation cumbersome.
* Inefficient Feedback Utilization
    * Lacks continuous and automated processes for ingesting and analyzing feedback from diverse channels (social media, app reviews, etc.).

Slide 2: Enhanced Solution
1. Multi-Agent Architecture with LLM Integration
    * Competitor Analysis Agent: Employs data validation (e.g., Pydantic) and dynamic prompt engineering to align the bank’s feature set with competitor insights.
    * Feedback Analysis Agent: Converts social media and app store reviews into structured enhancement proposals using large language models.
    * App Feature Developer Agent: Uses resource optimization algorithms (e.g., feature dependency graphs, topological sorting) and adversarial validation checks to ensure efficient deployment.
    * App Feature Deprecator Agent: Applies predictive usage modeling (logistic regression or neural networks) and potential FPGA-accelerated real-time monitoring to identify underused features.
2. Real-Time Lifecycle Management
    * New features proposed, validated, and deployed rapidly.
    * Underused features automatically flagged and removed upon user consent.

Slide 3: Online Banking Business Use Cases (with Examples)
1. Rapid Competitive Response
    * Example: A competitor offers “crypto micro-investments”; the system’s real-time gap analysis flags it, triggers resource-optimized development, and rolls out a similar feature 40% faster than manual processes.
2. Personalized Interface Streamlining
    * Example: Predictive usage modeling calculates a 95% probability that “travel insurance aggregator” is unused; the Deprecator Agent prompts the customer to remove it, reducing UI clutter and reclaiming 30% of associated server resources.
3. Dynamic User Feedback Loop
    * Example: Sentiment analysis identifies recurring complaints about a “bill-splitting” feature. The system automatically updates the code to address the root cause, validated by adversarial checks that ensure no new regulatory conflicts are introduced.

Slide 4: Novelty & Patentability
1. Technical Improvements
    * Resource Optimization: Minimizes cloud server load during feature deployment, validated through topological sorting and dependency graphs.
    * Predictive Deprecation: Statistical models (e.g., logistic regression) plus possible FPGA offloading for real-time usage pattern analysis.
2. Non-Abstract Implementation
    * Integrates LLM-driven agents with specialized data validation (Pydantic) and automated feedback processing.
    * Inventive Step: Transforms intangible feedback (social media reviews, competitor insights) into “concrete” product changes and usage-based disposal.

Slide 5: Business Benefits
1. Faster Time-to-Market
    * Intelligent prioritization and automated approval reduce latency in feature development by up to 40%
2. Reduced Infrastructure & Maintenance Costs
    * Predictive deprecation reclaims around 35% of server capacity from low-usage features.
3. Improved User Satisfaction & Retention
    * Personalized banking interfaces (UI clutter reduced, new features deployed quickly) drive higher user engagement and lower churn.
4. Compliance & Risk Reduction
    * Robust validation (both adversarial and usage-based) mitigates errors that might otherwise lead to system downtime or regulatory issues, improving reliability.

2 (Improvised) ———————————— Slide 1: Problem Statement
* Static Recommendations & Delayed Compliance
    * Traditional banking systems provide generic product offers and rely on periodic compliance checks, leading to missed personalization opportunities and regulatory blind spots.
* Fragmented Data Sources
    * Social media posts, session videos, and internal logs are seldom combined in real time.
* Regulatory Risk
    * Emerging mandates (e.g., GDPR, potential quantum encryption standards by 2027) require robust security and auditability.

Slide 2: Enhanced Solution
1. Multi-Agent Architecture (All LLM-Driven)
    * Product Interest Agent: Incorporates edge computing (on-device partial data processing) for quick detection of user intent from clickstream or video.
    * Product Recommendation Agent: Integrates blockchain-anchored audit trails for each recommended offer, ensuring decisions are logged immutably.
    * Compliance Monitoring Agent: Employs multi-modal LLMs across text, video, and external social media, using an optional regulatory sandbox simulation to predict potential violations.
2. Real-Time Adaptation
    * Homepage personalizations and compliance flags update continuously, guided by a cross-agent arbitration system that balances commercial and regulatory objectives.
3. Quantum-Resistant Security
    * Lattice-based cryptography secures user data and LLM training records, anticipating future quantum threats.

Slide 3: Online Banking Business Use Cases (with Examples)
1. Edge-Enhanced Mortgage Recommendations
    * Example: Customer’s device pre-processes face or gaze data while viewing mortgage videos; the Product Interest Agent quickly flags high intent, and the Product Recommendation Agent responds with immediate in-app offers.
2. Instant Compliance Overrides
    * Example: Surge in social media complaints about hidden fees triggers a high-risk score in the Compliance Monitoring Agent. The system halts promotional campaigns for the affected product, preventing legal exposure.
3. Regulatory Sandbox Testing
    * Example: Simulated user transactions revealing potential AML (Anti-Money Laundering) flags are fed into the sandbox. The system fine-tunes the compliance rules before exposing them to real-world conditions.

Slide 4: Novelty & Technical Contributions
1. Real-Time, Multi-Modal LLM Analysis
    * Integrates video session captures, text logs, social media data, and synthetic scenario tests, surpassing static textual checks in existing solutions.
2. Edge Computing & Blockchain-Audited Process
    * Partially processes data on user devices to reduce latency and secures agent decisions on a permissioned blockchain for regulatory inspections.
3. Closed-Loop Learning & Priority Arbitration
    * Continuous feedback loop updates the LLMs using live user engagement metrics, with a proprietary weighting algorithm resolving conflicts between commercial KPIs and compliance constraints.
4. Quantum-Resistant Encryption & Zero-Knowledge Proofs
    * Sensitive training data and transaction logs are secured with lattice-based cryptography, future-proofing the system against quantum threats while maintaining user privacy.

Slide 5: Business Benefits
1. Higher Conversion & Engagement
    * Personalized, instant offers based on real-time session insights lead to an uplift in cross-selling and upselling effectiveness.
2. Regulatory Risk Mitigation
    * Live compliance checks, combined with blockchain-anchored audit trails, reduce the window for violations to go unnoticed, strengthening legal standing.
3. Scalable, Secure Architecture
    * Edge computing offloads processing, speeding up local inference while lattice-based encryption guards sensitive data.
4. Proactive & Transparent Customer Experience
    * Continual updates on product offers and compliance ticket statuses build trust and foster long-term loyalty.
